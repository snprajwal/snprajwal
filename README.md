I am a student pursuing my engineering in computer science from Bengaluru, India. My areas of interest include distributed systems, networking, and scalable architecture design. I am actively involved in open-source projects related to Kubernetes.

I'm a generalist, and have spent considerable time poring over articles, research papers, and repositories to try and understand today's technological ecosystem better. My aim is to play a role in making this ecosystem scalable, better accessible, and more secure, through back-end development.

My desire to understand everything about what I'm doing has made me develop a wide knowledge base, which lets me conveniently analyse problems from multiple perspectives. I have also interned as a back-end developer at a leading startup in India, which made me proficient in Go and its related tooling ecosystem. I bring a diverse set of skills to the table, along with an approximate knowledge of most things.
